# Prototype
This is the prototype game I created for my university thesis "Follow the Magic Flute".

The prototype is a simple 3D first person game that features one specific game mechanic. How this mechanic is introduced to the player is the focus of my thesis.

Two builds of the prototype can be found in the Unity project folder (Prototype v2 > Builds). "Group A" includes a tutorial that describes the game mechanic. "Group B" does not.

Feel free to download this project and use it for further research.
